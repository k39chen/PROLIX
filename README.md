PROLIX
======

A bottom-up implementation of a C++ game engine using SDL (Simple Direct Media Library) and OpenGL.
_______________
Structured into the following primary components:

+ `PRLXEngine` - The core of the PROLIX engine, responsible for managing the life cycle of all the engine components
+ `PRLXGraphics` - Responsible for managing, accessing, manipulating, and rendering binary image resources
+ `PRLXInput` - Handles user keyboard/mouse inputs and serves up the event data accordingly
+ `PRLXMixer` - Serves as the audio resource management system and controls playback of sound files (BGM/SFX)
+ `PRLXPhysics` - The physics engine that performs hittests and kinematic calculations
+ `PRLXText` - Helps to load font resources and render/animate text

Demo videos of PROLIX performance and capabilities are accessible at `/demos`.
